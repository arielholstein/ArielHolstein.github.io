JJEP is a joint jewish education program that happens in Rodef Shalom Congregation. I worked here as an assistant teacher during my senior year of high school in 2019. On Wednesday's I would be part of the group Torah reading and then would assist in a classroom of 2nd and 3rd graders by teaching them the alphabet and basic words. On Sundays I would assist in the highest class which was 7th grade. I also taught an entire lesson to this class as part of the job. Finally, Sunday mornings, before I went to 7th grade, I would babysit the kids whose parents were in Family Hebrew. A picture of this can be seen below.

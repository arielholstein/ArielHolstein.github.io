JJEP is a joint jewish education program that happens in Rodef Shalom Congregation. I worked here a teacher during my freshman year of college in 2019. For a semester, on Sundays I taught an elective course to 6th and 7th graders with a lot of different activities. I would lesson plan the week prior and send in my lessons for editing and review. The students enjoyed my class and I enjoyed teaching it. We had a lot of fun together.

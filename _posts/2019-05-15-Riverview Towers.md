Riverview towers is a senior independent apartment building. They have a big hall where they like to have all kinds of events. I volunteered here for about two years. I would help set up and run events for the residents. Additionally, I would help residents with computer and technological problems. It was always fun to do and it was great to see the joy I brought upon the residents.

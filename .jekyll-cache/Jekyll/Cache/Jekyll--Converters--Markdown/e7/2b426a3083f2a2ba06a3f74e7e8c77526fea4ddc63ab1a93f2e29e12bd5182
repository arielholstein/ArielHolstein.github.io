This is a great organization which provides all kinds of different activities to interact and have fun with kids with disabilities. It focuses on inclusion. I volunteered here for three years and got a lot out of it. I always had fun and met a lot of new friends and most importantly it helped me grow as a person. It gave me a much more open and caring perspective and to make sure everyone was always treated the same and felt included.

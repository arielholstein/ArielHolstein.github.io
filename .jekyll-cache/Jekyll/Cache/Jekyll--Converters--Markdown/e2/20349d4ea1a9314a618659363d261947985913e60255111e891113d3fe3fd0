In my high school there is a blood drive every year. The National Honors Society runs it and members donate but also volunteer to help with it. I volunteered my time and helped for three years in 2017, 2018, and 2019. I made sure things went smoothly and gave the donors a cookie and juice after their donation. It was great helping and I enjoyed it every time.

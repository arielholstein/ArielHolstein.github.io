I have been refereeing since 2016. I referee the weapons foil and epee. I started with local tournaments at my club. I then became noticed by surrounding clubs in my city and began refereeing more often. In 2019 I was invited to referee the summer nationals tournament and flew out to Columbus, Ohio. There are some pictures below from that tournament. I was also supposed to referee at the 2020 summer nationals before the pandemic shut it down. I enjoy refereeing and improving as the tournaments go along. Whenever opportunities arise I love to take them. I hope to referee international tournaments one day.
